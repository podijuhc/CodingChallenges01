**Problem:**
Create a Python program that asks for a student's score and then provides a grade based on the score.

**Instructions:**
1. Ask the user to enter their score (out of 100).
2. Store the score in a variable.
3. Use conditional statements to print the grade based on the score.
    - If the score is greater than or equal to 90, print: `"Grade: A"`
    - If the score is between 80 and 89, print: `"Grade: B"`
    - If the score is between 70 and 79, print: `"Grade: C"`
    - If the score is between 60 and 69, print: `"Grade: D"`
    - If the score is below 60, print: `"Grade: F"`


**Pseudocode**
1. Start
2. Prompt the user to enter their score (out of 100).
3. Store the score in a variable called score.
4. If the score is greater than or equal to 90:
5. Print "Grade: A"
6. Else if the score is between 80 and 89 (inclusive):
7. Print "Grade: B"
8. Else if the score is between 70 and 79 (inclusive):
9. Print "Grade: C"
10. Else if the score is between 60 and 69 (inclusive):
11. Print "Grade: D"
12. Else (if the score is below 60):
13. Print "Grade: F"
