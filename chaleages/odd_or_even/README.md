**Problem:**
Create a Python program that asks the user for a number and then tells them if the number is even or odd.

**Instructions:**
1. Ask the user to enter a number.
2. Store the number in a variable.
3. Use conditional statements to check if the number is even or odd.
    - If the number is even (i.e., divisible by 2), print: `"The number is even."`
    - If the number is odd, print: `"The number is odd."`

**Pseudocode**

2. ask user for a number 
3. make a variable named num
4. if num is divides by 2 
5. print itss even
