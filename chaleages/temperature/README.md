**Problem:**
Write a Python program that asks the user for the current temperature and suggests whether they should wear a jacket, short-sleeves, or stay indoors.

**Instructions:**
1. Ask the user to enter the current temperature (in Celsius).
2. Store the temperature in a variable.
3. Use conditional statements to give advice based on the temperature.
    - If the temperature is below 10째C, print: `"It's cold outside. Wear a jacket!"`
    - If the temperature is between 10째C and 25째C, print: `"It's a nice day. Wear short-sleeves!"`
    - If the temperature is above 25째C, print: `"It's hot outside. Stay cool!"`

**Pseudocode:**
1. start 
2. ask user for the temprature 
3. if temprature <= 10
4. print It's cold outside. Wear a jacket!
5. elif temprature >= 10 and temprature <= 20 
6. print its a nice day. Wear short-sleeves!
7. elif temprature >= 25
8. print It's hot outside. Stay cool!
