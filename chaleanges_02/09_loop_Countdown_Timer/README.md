**Problem:**
Write a program that starts at `10` and counts down to `1`,
but if the user enters `"stop"`, the countdown should break.  

**Pseudocode:**
1. start 
2. SET count = 10
3. WHILE count > 0
4. PRINT "Countdown:", count
5. give user chose of stopping
6. IF input = "stop" THEN
7. PRINT "Stopped!"
8. BREAK
9. END IF
10. count = count - 1
11. END WHILE
12. PRINT "Finished!"
