**Problem:**
Write a program that generates a random number between `1` and `10` and keeps
asking the user to guess it using a `while` loop **until they guess correctly**.  

**Example:**  
```
Guess the number: 4  
Wrong, try again!  
Guess the number: 7  
Correct! 🎉
```

**Pseudocode:**

1. start
2. ask computer for a random number 
3. ask user to guss a number 
4. if the number guessed by user is the same as the computer print good job
5. if its not print try again
6. repeat till the user guess the number
